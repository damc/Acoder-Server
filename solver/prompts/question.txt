Question:
Is it possible to have two Python packages in one project? How would the directory structure look like in such case?

Answer:
Yes, it is possible to have two Python packages in one project.

The directory structure would look like this:

my_project/
    __init__.py
    my_package/
        __init__.py
        my_module.py
    my_package2/
        __init__.py
        my_module.py

The __init__.py files are required to make Python treat the directories as containing packages; this is done to prevent directories with a common name, such as string, from unintentionally hiding valid modules that occur later on the module search path. In the simplest case, __init__.py can just be an empty file, but it can also execute initialization code for the package or set the __all__ variable, described later.

I have a Flask application. I use SQLAlchemy for database. I have a simple table "User". I've just added a column 'requests' to that table. When I run the application, I recieve a SQL error that the column "requests" doesn't exist. How can I migrate my database to add that new "requests" column? Does SQLALchemy use database migrations (like for example Doctrine from PHP)? How does it work in SQLAlchemy?

Answer:
You can use Alembic to create a migration.

Alembic is a database migration tool for SQLAlchemy.

Question:
I have a MySQL database. I want to give a user the permission to read a table (e.g. execute SELECT query), but I don't want them to have the permission to write to the table (e.g. execute INSERT query). Is it possible? If so, what query do I need to run to accomplish that?

Answer:
You can use the REVOKE command to revoke permissions from a user.

You can use the GRANT command to give permissions to a user.

Example:

SQL Query:
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES, GRANT OPTION FROM 'user'@'localhost';

SQL Query:
GRANT SELECT ON `table` TO 'user'@'localhost';
