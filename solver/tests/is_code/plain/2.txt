You can get enough food no trouble. You probably have to change up your usual weekly shop a bit.

The supermarkets near me have been out of more than half of their fresh fruit and veg options basically since new year. Fresh herbs are worse, that shelf is usually entirely empty. What specifically they do or don't have varies each time I go, but more than half of the fruit and veg aisle is empty every time. I have absolutely no trouble getting enough veg! But I have to take what they have rather than being able to choose. Some stuff is more likely to be out than others. Carrots and mushrooms are basically always in stock (which suits me fine as I like both) but all of the supermarkets near me have been out of potatoes for over a month now, for example.

Outside of fruit and veg, pasta and pasta-adjacent things (pesto etc) are a coin flip at the moment. They're clean out about half the time I go shopping. Most other things I eat have been fine. Meat section always has mostly empty shelves but I've never seen them actually out of chicken.

Tl;dr there's still plenty to feed everyone, but variety has gone down the toilet particularly with fresh fruit, veg and herbs.

EDIT: Oh man, and cheese! It's become a case of "you can have any cheese you want as long as it's cheddar". There's always shelves and shelves full of cheddar and nothing else.
