We had some people in my village who did this for us kids because we were wandering around at night being noisy teenagers. I have some of the best memories from that time. We went ice skating, hired a mechanical bull ride with surrounded inflatable, hired a human gyroscope, hired an inflatable bungee run, went to EuroDisney. When we didn't have that, we had games in the village hall and we were allowed to play British Bulldog. (I have an apology to make there. I stomped on a boys hand because I was an idiot and he had a crush on me that somehow translated to me feeling negative to him. The look of betrayal on his face is still burned in my head 25 years later - I know he won't see this but P. Connor, wherever you are, I'm really sorry. I was a massive dickhead and you didn't deserve it at all. I did get a massive bollocking for it at the time, but I still am sorry.)

The things they organised for us were incredible and our little village became the talk of the school and people would come from town to join in. Such an awesome group of people.
