    Dave Chappelle Gets Standing Ovation Amid Netflix Special Controversy: “If This Is What Being Canceled Is, I Love It”

    GLAAD condemns Dave Chappelle, Netflix for transphobic The Closer

Some excerpts. There are like 8000 comments between both threads at this point though, so it's probably just the tip of the iceberg:

    "He clearly doesn’t hate any of the groups he makes fun of so I really don’t understand why people are so damn mad. You don’t have to watch his special or engage in the conversation if it’s not the type of comedy you enjoy."

    "Im so over old rich offensive men"

    "every single person going online to talk about how horrible and awful he is just continues to prove his point for him"

    On the suicide of Chappelle's trans friend: "Dave Chappelle contributed to her suicide and he made a bit out of it... He trotted her out in 2019 as his "I can't be transphobic I've got a trans friend!" and he's still getting paid $20 million a special and she's dead."

    "Having a bunch of Netflix specials is literally the opposite of being cancelled."

    "Uhh? Have you ever watched or listened to Dave Chapelle’s comedy?"

    He is multi multi multi multi multi multi multi multi millionaire with a platform on the largest streaming site on the planet. But yeah somehow he is a huge victim. Its absurd.

        You obviously didn’t listen to his special. He never claimed victimhood.

    "Isn't that the exact same thing that John Oliver and Stephen Colbert do every night?

BONUS DRAMA FROM r/standupcomedy:

    "I didn't hear a single negative thing about trans people... which shows they're all kind of stupid for trying to protest something that isn't an issue. Fucking Drama Queens."
