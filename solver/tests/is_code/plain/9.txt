I spent over a grand for a nice weekend away with my ex and she spent the whole fucking time on her phone, and told me I was controlling as I wanted to eat / do anything that didn't involve being read out what one of her mates did from Facebook. Got home, dropped at her place and told her to get where to go. The only time she was t on her phone was when she was running up a Â£200 bar bill on her own.
