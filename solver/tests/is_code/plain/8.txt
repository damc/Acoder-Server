Same. Five lads took up our seats, we got them to move, then they stole another set of seats and proceeded to talk loudly and multiple intervals, do this flashing strobe thing on their phones, try record like 5 second clips of the movie several times, then left halfway through to everybody's relief.

Why bother? Like you're in there to intentionally piss people off? How sad is that? It was last night too so prime time Friday evening. I'd be out getting pissed and having a laugh.
