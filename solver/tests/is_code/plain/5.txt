On Tuesday, ten minutes before her lecture, the philosophy professor Kathleen Stock found stickers in the ladies’ loos accusing her of voicing “transphobic shit”. Shaken, she moved her talk online. On Wednesday morning, she found the underpass leading to the Sussex University campus plastered in posters demanding she be sacked. “The tunnel was bustling with students and staff. When I saw my name, I stopped dead. It was like a terrible stress dream,” she says.

Hyperventilating and crying, Stock had a panic attack. She went home, just missing masked figures letting off flares beside a sign reading “Stock Out”. A menacing new Instagram account, Anti Terf Sussex, which has 1,100 followers, states: “Our demand is simple: fire Kathleen Stock. Otherwise you’ll see us around.”
