The UK's Brexit Minister Lord Frost has warned that using Article 16 may be the only way to bring about changes to the Northern Ireland Brexit deal.

Lord Frost said the Northern Ireland Protocol - put in place to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland - was "not working and needs to change".

He said he worried the UK's proposals would not be agreed by the EU.

Lord Frost said triggering Article 16, which would suspend part of the deal, may end up as "the only way" forward.

What is Article 16?

In October 2019, the UK and EU agreed a special Brexit deal for Northern Ireland, known as the protocol.

It leaves Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods.

That means that goods can flow freely between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, removing the threat of a "hard border".

However goods arriving into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are now subject to checks and control.

This arrangement is referred to as the Irish Sea border.

Article 16 of the protocol sets out the process for taking unilateral "safeguard" measures if either the EU or UK concludes that the operation of the deal is leading to serious problems.

Those safeguards would amount to suspending parts of the deal.
What exactly does Article 16 say?

Safeguard measures can be taken if the protocol is leading to serious "economic, societal or environmental difficulties" that are liable to persist.

So, while it is not intended to be used for temporary or minor problems there is no specific guidance on what qualifies as a "serious" difficulty.

Additionally, it can be used if the protocol is leading to "diversion of trade", but again there is no guidance on how exactly that should be interpreted.

The UK government says that, in its opinion, the threshold has been reached for using safeguards, but it is choosing not to use them for now.
