Twenty years ago I was in Â£25,000 in debt with nothing to show for it. It took 18 months of working 6.5 days a week to pay it off.

Credit card companies just hound you when you turn 18, offering ridiculous credit limits. All the clothing stores throw stores cards at you. They should do some money management lessons in high school. All of my friends got into similar situations. Thankfully now I have a good chunk of savings, not that they earn much interest.
