<p>Acoder is a console application for increasing programmer's productivity by generating code using artificial intelligence (powered by GPT-3 from OpenAI).</p>

<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>tl;dr - you can install Acoder from Snapstore.</p>

<h2>Linux</h2>

<h3>Ubuntu Software (1st way)</h3>
<p>On Ubuntu 20, you can install Acoder by simply opening "Ubuntu Software" and searching for "Acoder".</p>

<h3>Snap install (2nd way)</h3>
<p>Run:</p>
<code>sudo snap install acoder --classic</code>
<p>If you don't have Snapstore installed already, then see this page for instructions: <a href="https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snap-store-app">installing snap store app</a>.</p>

<h2>MacOS And Windows</h2>
<p>Currently, the application is available only in Snapstore. As far as I know, Snapstore works only with Linux. However, it should be availible to install with Homebrew soon. Check this website after 2 weeks.</p>

<h1>Usage</h1>

<p>Run in your terminal:</p>
<code>acoder</code>
<p>... and follow the instructions.</p>

<p>Before you can use Acoder, you will need to sign up on this website. After you sign up, you can see an API key which you need to provide to the application (only when you use Acoder for the first time) using the following command:</p>
<code>acoder configure [your API key here]</code>
<p>After that run:</p>
<code>acoder template</code>
<p>This will generate template file "task.md". Open that file and fill the file according to the instructions inside the file.</p>
<p>After that run:</p>
<code>acoder solve</code>
<p>Acoder will display a proposition of changes to the code which you can then accept or reject (or try again).</p>
