I have a goal and I look to collaborate with other people to accomplish that goal.

# What do I want to do?

The goal is to create an application that allows to automate creating applications (or at least increase improve the speed at which those applications are created).

I also want to create a new governance system that is better than the commonly used governance system and I want the project to be governened by that system at some point.

# What can I offer in exchange for help?

I can offer:

1. Money.
2. Equity/share.
3. The power to decide about the project.
4. Credit attribution.

# What do I need?

1. Money.
2. Execution of ideas (mainly, programming at this point).
3. Ideas (how to improve the product/products).
4. Decision-making.

The first two are currently the bottleneck (so they are more important at this stage).

# How to collaborate

If you want to collaborate, then send me an email to acoder2@outlook.com.

If you want to contribute by programming, then I need to tell you how things are going to work (disclose my ideas). That is a cost, so I'm limiting the number of people who can contribute to the project.

Currently, I'm looking for one person who will help me with programming of the new application.

The requirements are as follows:

1. The person must get at least 10 point at the below programming tasks (send me the solution to acoder2@outlook.com) - because I want to select a person who is capable of programming and who is willing to spend some time on working on the project (if a person has solved the task, then it means that they are capable and that they are willing to sacrifice some time).
2. The person must be willing to sign a non-disclosure agreement that will forbid to disclose the ideas - because the ideas gives us a competetive advantage that allows us to get fairly rewarded for out contribution.

I will choose one person to join me. It will be the person who at 6th March will have the highest number of points. You can get the points by solving the below tasks (and sending me the solutions).

The programming tasks are as follows:

1. Write a Python function that given a code of a Python function (as a string), returns the type of the returned value of the given function. You can assume that the declaration of the given function contains type annotations (that task is for 5 points).
2. Write a Python function that given a code in some programming language, outputs the name of the programming language in which the code is written. The code can be in C++, Python, JavaScript, PHP or GoLang. The solution doesn't need to have 100% accuracy, but the better the accuracy, the more points you will get (you can get from 0 to 15 point for that task).
3. Write a Python function that given a name of a Python package (e.g. "requests") and a Python code, finds all names of the functions, methods or classes that are used in the code from that package. You can assume that the package is imported in the code like this: "import [name of the package]" (e.g. "import requests") (that task is for 5 points).

If you have any questions about the tasks, feel free to email me at acoder2@outlook.com.

It is allowed to use Acoder (or other code generation tools) in the process of solving the above tasks.
