Hello YC people.

This page exists so that you can learn about the progress since the time when I sent the application to YCombinator.

# Update 1

You can learn more about the current progress here: [Progress](/progress).

That is not up-to-date, but it's worth checking. The more recent progress is in the following updates.

# Update 2

Additionally, I recently had a conversation with patent attorneys in order to receive an opinion about patentability of my method (the method which my application will be based on). The opinion of the patent attorneys was that my method is most likely patentable (within United States).

# Update 3

Additionally, I have decided to change the strategy.

The previous strategy was like this:

1. Create the product - application that generates applications, based on the algorithm/method, built on top of Codex.
2. Find users.
3. Profit.

The current strategy is like this:

1. Find few users (I don't need to look for them now because I will be my first user).
2. Create the application (that user has requested) by following the algorithm manually (instead of programmatically).
3. Gradually automate the process of generating the application, starting from the subprocesses of which automation gives the highest benefit.
4. Profit.
5. Find more users than few.
6. More profit.

Thanks to the current strategy, I will be learning faster about the potential issues with the method and which parts of it are important and about user needs. I will also be able to have paying users sooner.

# Update 4

I'd like to give an update, but I don't have time to write it now. I don't promise, but it's possible that I will write the next update here in few days and it's possible that I will record and share a demonstration of the current progress with that update.

# Update 5

It's time for the update that I promised to give in the previous update.

After I started to applying the method manually, I very quickly realized that it takes lots of time to do it manually because it requires constructing prompts which takes lots of time when done manually, but it takes only a fraction of a second, when done programmatically. Therefore using this method manually doesn't make lots of sense. For that reason (and some other), I changed the strategy again. The current strategy is to create a tool for developers to help them increase the speed at which they write code. I will be gradually improving that tool - it will be gradually becoming more capable and autonomous. At some point, it will be so capable and autonomous that it will not require programming knowledge to create a web application using it, so at that point it will be for non-technical users as well. In other words, the change to strategy is that at the beginning I will be creating a tool for developers and at some point it will become a tool for non-technical users. The previous strategy was targeting non-technical users from the start.

Since sending the application to YCombinator, I have been writing code and then realizing a better way to do things a few times (although the core idea on how the program will work remains the same). As a result, I didn't make huge visible progress, because I have been starting from scratch a couple of times.

Below is the demonstration of the progress. I appear tired / low energy on the video and my English on the video is a bit shitty. Please don't draw hasty conclusions based on that - I had a sleep debt when I was recording that video (what I mean by that is that I didn't sleep a lot a couple of days before recording).
